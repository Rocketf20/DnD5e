Hello, these are steps for how to clone or download this repo.
Disclaimer, I have never worked with command prompt or non unix based systems so the steps for file navigationa and creation may be a bit different. Look around for commands that are similar to the ones for unix based systems.
If you do not have git installed on your computer and you are on mac type 
$ git --version
in your terminal window and it should bring you up to the installer.
STEP 1: Open Terminal
Go to the top right of your screen by the magnifing glass on Mac and type 
Terminal
and hit enter
STEP 2: Navigating to the Target Directory
We want to navigate to where we want to store this repo
To see what is in a directory type 
$ ls 
if you want to see hidden objects as well type
$ ls -a 
To move to a directery type
$ cd [targetdirectory]
STEP 3: Creating local Directory 
We know want to create our local directory, type
$ mkdir [localname]
this should create an empty local directory then navigate into it with
$ cd [localname]
STEP 4: Cloning Repo
To clone or download the repository type
$ git clone github.com/rocketf20/DnD5e
you should see the a message saying how the repository should be cloning this may take a bit as their are some larger pdf files that make take a minute depending on your download speed.
STEP 5: Enjoy
All up to you now.
